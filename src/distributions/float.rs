//! Basic floating-point number distributions

use core::mem;

use distributions::{Distribution, Standard};

/// Generate a floating point number in the half-open interval `[0, 1)` with a
/// uniform distribution.
///
/// This is different from `Uniform` in that it uses all 32 bits of an RNG for a
/// `f32`, instead of only 23, the number of bits that fit in a floats fraction
/// (or 64 instead of 52 bits for a `f64`).
///
/// The smallest interval between values that can be generated is 2^-32
/// (2.3283064e-10) for `f32`, and 2^-64 (5.421010862427522e-20) for `f64`.
/// But this interval increases further away from zero because of limitations of
/// the floating point format. Close to 1.0 the interval is 2^-24 (5.9604645e-8)
/// for `f32`, and 2^-53 (1.1102230246251565) for `f64`. Compare this with
/// `Uniform`, which has a fixed interval of 2^23 and 2^-52 respectively.
///
/// Note: in the future this may change change to request even more bits from
/// the RNG if the value gets very close to 0.0, so it always has as many digits
/// of precision as the float can represent.
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// use rand::{NewRng, SmallRng, Rng};
/// use rand::distributions::HighPrecision01;
///
/// let val: f32 = SmallRng::new().sample(HighPrecision01);
/// println!("f32 from [0,1): {}", val);
/// ```

    /// 52 for `f64`.
    /// The resulting value will fall in a range that depends on the exponent.
    /// As an example the range with exponent 0 will be
